## Race, Gender, Class in the Digital World

> Provides students with key knowledge of race, gender, class and social justice especially in relation to technology in today’s digital world. Students challenge the barriers of expertise, gender, race, class, and location that restrict wider access to and understanding of the production and usage of new technologies. Students will engage in a practical experience in the community via their service placements, which will provide depth and context for considering questions of justice, equality, social responsibilities and the complexities of technology and its societal impact. The course uses scenario based approach combining presentations, discussions, and reflections to allow students explore the relationship between critical reflection and action on the topics mentioned above.

Worked with the Noble Reach foundation, which is a non-profit organization that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation to solve major societal and national challenges. I was partnered with InnSure, which works to find ways for the insurance industry to combat climate risk. Our team focuses efforts on wildfire risks and mitigations.
