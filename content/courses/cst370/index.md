# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

>Students learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.

## Summary

In this course we solved small C problems that illustrated specific algorithmic concepts. In a lot of ways it was like learning to solve a puzzle or how to play a video game. Over time, by combining the insights, skills, and knowledged we gained we were able to tackle harder and more intricate algorythms.
