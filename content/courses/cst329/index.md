# Reasoning with Logic

>In this course students learn to develop skill in using logic to describe and assess arguments. Students will learn to write formulas in propositional and first-order logic, and more importantly, to write and check proofs. Students will also learn to write formulas in three-valued and modal logic, know how to choose an appropriate logic, and understand the limitations of logic in capturing human reasoning.

In CST-329 we learned how to reason with logic ...very Vulcan. It's actually a fun thought process, training your mind to logically think or behave as how a computer would.
